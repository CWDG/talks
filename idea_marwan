Hi.  I'm Marwan.  I'm the guy with the really poofy hair that usually sits next to the super talkative guy in the front left corner.
I'm planning to do a talk on October 29 about creating relational databases with Rails.  It's actually kinda the next step after building Baby's First Rails App.  

This talk has been moved to the November 5th, 2013.

Also, it will be about sessions not relational databases.
