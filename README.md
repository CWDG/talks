#Presentations at CWDG

When we make presentations we always want to make sure
our members can see them later.

##How to contribute your talk

Fork this repo.

If you just want to include you resources without version control that's
fine.

You can also add your talk as a [git submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)
so that you can preserve the history.

If you have any questions post an issue and we'll be happy to help you out
